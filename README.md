STAT0023 Coursework Programs
This repository contains two programs that were written for the STAT0023 coursework. The first program uses the Simpson method to numerically approximate an integral, and the second program uses multidimensional scaling to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset.

Simpson Method Program
The simpson_method.r file contains a Python implementation of the Simpson method for approximating the integral of a function. The program takes in the function to be integrated, as well as the upper and lower bounds of the integration interval, and outputs the numerical approximation of the integral. The program has been tested with a variety of functions and is designed to be easy to use and modify.

Multidimensional Scaling Program
The multidimensional_scaling.r file contains a Python implementation of multidimensional scaling, which is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. The program takes in a dataset as input, and uses multidimensional scaling to produce a lower-dimensional representation of the data that preserves the pairwise distances between data points. The program has been tested with a variety of datasets and is designed to be easy to use and modify.

Usage
To use these programs, simply download the repository and run the desired program in a R environment. The programs can be modified to suit your needs by changing the input parameters or modifying the code directly.
